# Abstract


Phylogenetics is the scientific discipline dedicated to unravelling the evolutionary relationships among species, typically represented using phylogenetic trees. Constructing these trees involves modeling the evolutionary processes based on genetic sequences. 

There are two primary types of models employed: one-class models and mixture models. While mixture models have been introduced to better account for heterogeneity in genes, their application in inferring phylogenetic trees remains limited, and their performance is not well-understood. 

In this study, our goal is to assess and compare the performance of one-class models and mixture models within the context of phylogenetic analysis, with a specific focus on the largest order of pleurocarpous mosses. Our investigation covers critical aspects including branch length estimation, tree topology, model fitting, and inference of evolutionary processes.
